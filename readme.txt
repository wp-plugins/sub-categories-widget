This Widget lists the sub-categories for a given category.


== Description ==

Sometimes when you divide up your WordPress content into categories it all ends up in sub-categories of one or two main categories that don't have any content themselves.

With the widget you can add a list of sub-categories even if the parent doesn't have posts.

You can display sub-categories without posts and you can even add the number of posts in each sub-category.


== Installation ==

Installing is pretty easy takes only a minute or two.

1. Upload 'sub-category-widget' directory to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.

3. On the 'Widgets' sub-menu of 'Appearance' you will find a new widget type called 'Sub Category'.

4. Add one or more of these to your themes widget display areas.

5. For each widget you add, select a title and category, then decide if you'd like empty categories and post counts shown.

6. Save your settings.

7. That's it.  Enjoy!
